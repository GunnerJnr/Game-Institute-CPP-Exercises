4.9.4 Quadratic Equation 

Background Info 

Recall that the standard form of a quadratic equation is given by:

     y = ax² + bx + c

Here, a, b, and c are called the coefficients of the quadratic equation. Geometrically, this describes a parabola—Figure 4.11. Often we want to find the values of 
x where the parabola intersects the x-axis; that is, find x such that y = ax² + bx + c = 0. These values of x are called the roots of the quadratic equation.

Exercise 

 Write a function that inputs (i.e., takes as parameters) the coefficients of a quadratic equation, and outputs the result.  The function should return two solutions 
 with two parts: 
     1) A real part and 
     2) an imaginary part.  
     
Of course, if a solution does not have an imaginary part (or real part, for that matter) then the corresponding component will just be zero (e.g., i20+, i03+).
The function should be prototyped as follows: 

    bool QuadraticFormula(float a, float b, float c,   float& r1, float& i1, float& r2, float& i2);
    
Where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.  And where r1 denotes the real part of solution 1 and where i1 denotes the imaginary part of solution 1. 
Likewise, r2 denotes the real part of solution 2 and i2 denotes the imaginary part of solution 2.
 
 Note that the return type is a bool. The return value is determined as follows:
 
     If the function contains an imaginary part 
         then return false, 
    otherwise 
        return true.  

We do this because some applications might not want to work with non-real results (i.e., results that have imaginary parts), and such application can easily test for 
a non-real result by examining the return value of this function. 

Test your function with the coefficients given in the quadratic equations from the above three examples.  Your output should be formatted similar to this: 

    Coefficients a=1, b=2, c=5 yield S1 = -1 + 2i, and S2 = -1 – 2i
