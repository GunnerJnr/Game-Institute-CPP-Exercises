4.9.3 Array Fill

Write a function called RandomArrayFill that inputs (i.e., takes a parameter) an integer array, and also that inputs (i.e., takes a parameter) an integer,
which contains the size of the array.  The function is then to write a random number, in the range [0, 100], to each element of the array.  
The function declaration of this function should look like so: 

    void RandomArrayFill(int* array, int size);
    
Now write a program that asks the user to input the size of an integer array.  The program then needs to create an array of exactly this size.  
Next, the program must pass this created array to the RandomArrayFill function, so that a random number is assigned to each element of the array.  
After which, the program must output every array element to the console window.  Your program output should look similar to this: 

Enter the size of an array to create: 6 
Creating array and filling it with random numbers... 
Array = {57, 23, 34, 66, 2, 96} 
Press any key to continue 

After you finish implementing the above function, rewrite it again, but this time using std::vector.  The function declaration of this new function should look like so: 

    void RandomArrayFill(std::vector& vec);
